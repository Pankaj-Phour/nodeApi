To get more help on the node application use `npm help` or go check out the [Node Overview and Command Reference](https://nodejs.org) page.

# Project important points 

Currently the project uses index.js and not index2.js but this doesn't mean that index2.js is useless I'll later merge both files code and write the code in proper structure of models routers etc. I'm leaving this for future.
